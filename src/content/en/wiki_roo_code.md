# [[Roo Code]]: The Open Source Ranger

> "My Key, My Rules."

**[[Roo Code]]** (formerly Roo / Root) is an Open Source VS Code extension. In a world of closed-source AI tools, it is a beacon of hope.

## Core Features

### 1. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

[[Cursor]] and [[Trae]] sell services.
[[Roo Code]] does not. You buy your own API Key from OpenRouter (usually cheaper) and plug it in.
This means you can use the latest **DeepSeek**, **Claude**, or your own fine-tuned model. No middleman.

### 2. Modes

It has built-in personas:

* **Architect**: Chat only, helps clarify thoughts.
* **Code**: Focuses on coding.
* **Ask**: Explains code.
You can also define custom modes, like a "[[Vue]] Expert".

### 3. Local Privacy First

Since it's open source, you see every line of code. If you are privacy-paranoid and can't send code to the cloud, [[Roo Code]] + Local Model (Ollama) is the only choice.

## Verdict

**"The embodiment of Cyberpunk spirit: Decentralized, Free, Controlled."**
