# Google Antigravity: Code Without Gravity

> "The IDE is dead. Long live the Platform."

**Antigravity** is Google's next-gen development platform. It's not an editor; it's a **Cloud Agent Orchestration System**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Cloud Native

Your code, environment, and Agents are all in the cloud.
Locally, you only need a lightweight client (or even a browser tab).

### 2. Agent Swarm

You are not fighting alone.
You summon an **Agent Swarm**:

* **Architect Agent**: Reviews requirements, breaks down tasks.
* **Coder Agent**: Writes code.
* **Tester Agent**: Writes and runs tests.
* **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews code.

You become the **"Mission Commander"**. You set strategic goals, and the Agents collaborate to execute them.

### 3. Artifacts

Agents communicate not via text, but **Artifacts**.
The Architect Agent produces a "Design Doc Artifact," passed to the Coder Agent; the Coder Agent produces a "Code Artifact."
The process is transparent and traceable.

## Verdict

**"This is the future. Maybe in 5 years, being able to speak is all you need to build software."**
