# Trae: The Dark Horse from ByteDance

> "Free, and Powerful."

**[[Trae]]** is an AI Native IDE from ByteDance. While [[Cursor]] dominates, [[Trae]] stormed in with extreme experience and a free tier.

## Core Features

### 1. Solo Mode

[[Trae]]'s signature feature.
While others are "Copilots", [[Trae]] offers "Solo".
In this mode, AI takes over. You give a task "Add a login box here", and [[Trae]] plans files, writes code, runs tests, and fixes errors. You just watch.

### 2. Native Chinese/English Fluency

Being a ByteDance product, its understanding of context is incredible. It gets the nuance, whether in English or Chinese demands.

### 3. Free Claude 3.5 Sonnet

It bundles the strongest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, for free (currently). For developers on a budget, this is irresistible.

## Verdict

**"Not just a tool, but the export of ByteDance's industrial engineering capability."**
