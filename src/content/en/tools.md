# The Cockpit: Tools of Trade (2025 Edition)

> "A worker is only as good as their tools. In 2025, your 'tools' are your autonomous squad."

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding Arsenal 2.0**.
The world moves fast. "Game-changing" tools from months ago are now vintage. We don't do nostalgia; we do power.

## 1. Command Centers: AI IDEs

VS Code is the foundation, but we are building skyscrapers.

### **Cursor** (Current King)

Still the smoothest AI editor experience.

- **Composer**: Its multi-file editing capability is still the benchmark.
- **Cmd+K**: Muscle memory.
- **Why**: Mature ecosystem, reliable.

### **Velite** (The Content Butler)

The unsung hero of Vibe Coding Academy.

- **Role**: Type-safe Content Layer.
- **Function**: Turns your Markdown into [[TypeScript]] data.
- **Status**: The best successor to Contentlayer.

### **Trae** (The Challenger)

A dark horse from ByteDance. Completely free and incredibly powerful.

- **Solo Mode**: A "fully autonomous" mode. You give it a requirement, it acts as a Senior Engineer: planning, coding, testing, and running.
- **Native Fluent**: Exceptional understanding of context, sometimes beating [[Cursor]].

### **GitHub Codespaces** (The Cloud Base)

- **Strength**: The browser is your IDE.
- **Dev Containers**: Solves environment configuration forever.
- **Scenario**: Remote work, coding on iPad, team collaboration.

## 2. Heavy Artillery: Lethal Models

Models are your ammo. In 2025, you only need to know two names.

### **Gemini 3.0** (God of Vibe)

Google's masterpiece.

- **Strength**: The definer of **Vibe Coding**. It understands not just code, but "feeling". Its multimodal capabilities (video/image input) are unmatched.
- **Use Case**: Idea landing, frontend design, generating Apps from sketches.

### **Claude 4.5** (The Logic Monster)

Anthropic's flagship.

- **Strength**: Rigorous logic. It doesn't just code; it architects. Its "Thinking" mode performs deep reasoning.
- **Use Case**: Complex backend logic, refactoring, system architecture.

## 3. Special Forces: Agentic Swarm

When the Chat window isn't enough, call in the **Special Forces**. These aren't chatbots; they are **autonomous agents**.

### **Antigravity** (Flagship)

Not a tool, but a **Platform**.

- **Concept**: "Code without gravity". Development happens in the cloud.
- **Power**: Command a full **Team of Agents**. One writes tests, one implements, one reviews. The ultimate form of a "One-Person Company".

### **Claude Code** (The Ghost)

A CLI-based operative.

- **Operation**: No UI, just terminal. Give it permission, and it ghosts through your file system.
- **Scenario**: "Replace the entire logging library with Pino and fix all errors." — It does it silently and submits a PR.

### **Roo Code** (The Ranger)

Open Source hero in VS Code.

- **Feature**: **Bring Your Own Key**. Use your [[OpenRouter]] key. Cheap and effective.
- **Modes**: Specialized modes like "Architect" and "Code" for different phases.

### **Augment Code** (Total Recall)

- **Strength**: Massive context memory. For legacy projects with millions of lines, Augment is the only one that instantly recalls "why we handle this error this way from 2 years ago."

### **Kiro** / **Kilo** (The Rigorous)

- **Feature**: **Spec-Driven**. They don't guess; they write documentation (Specs) first, then code. Perfect for mission-critical engineering.

## 4. Logistics & Supply: OpenRouter

If the tools above are weapons, **[[OpenRouter]]** is the universal **Ammo Depot**.
It aggregates almost all mainstream models globally. With just one Key, you accessed pay-as-you-go top-tier models like Claude 3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini 1.5.

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: The secret to saving money in Vibe Coding.
- **Freedom**: No longer bound by single-vendor subscriptions. Use whatever model you want.

## 5. Tactical Terminal: Warp

Even with AI, you need a sidearm.
**[[Warp]]** is the standard for the 21st Century. AI Command Search, Workflows, and Block Selection make the terminal human-friendly.

## Summary

In 2024, we learned how to **write** code.
In 2025, your job is to **command** these powerful AI partners.

Left hand **[[Trae]]/Cursor**, right hand **[[Antigravity]]**, ammo loaded with **[[Gemini 3.0]]**.
Go create.
