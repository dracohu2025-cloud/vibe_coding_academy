# [[Augment Code]]: The Omniscient Memory

> "It remembers everything."

All AI has a weakness: **Context Window**. They forget.
**[[Augment Code]]** was born to solve this.

## Core Features

### 1. Millisecond Full-Repo Indexing

Whether 1k or 1M files, Augment indexes in real-time.
It doesn't send files to AI on every request; it uses proprietary **RAG** to make AI "remember" the whole project.

### 2. The Strongest Completion

Completion is fast (<10ms). And because it reads the whole project, it suggests functions from 50 folders away not just by guessing, but by knowing.

### 3. Team Knowledge Share

Senior dev left? No problem.
Augment records **why** changes happened. New hire asks: "Why is this variable `magic_number`?" Augment tells the answer based on a commit message from 3 years ago.

## Verdict

**"For enterprise-scale legacy projects, Augment is the only external brain that can save you."**
