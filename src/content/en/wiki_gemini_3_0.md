# Gemini 3.0 Pro: The God of Vibe Coding

> "It doesn't just understand code; it understands your intent."

**[[Gemini 3.0]] Pro** is Google DeepMind's flagship model for 2025, fundamentally changing how we code and defining the concept of **"Vibe Coding"**.

## Core Features

### 1. Definitive Vibe Coding

Older models needed detailed Specs.
[[Gemini 3.0]] does not. You just say: "Give me a player like Spotify, but make it Cyberpunk style."
It instantly grasps your "Assert" (aesthetics) and "Vibe", generating a complete app with perfect CSS animations.

### 2. Native Multimodal

It reads pixels, not just text.

* **Screenshot to Code**: Draw a sketch or screenshot another app, and it replicates the UI pixel-perfectly.
* **Video Understanding**: Record a screen video saying "Fix this bug," and it understands where you clicked and what went wrong.

### 3. Infinite Context

Its context window is massive. You can throw the entire [[React]] source code at it and ask how a low-level Hook is implemented. It won't hallucinate; it explains like a senior engineer with 10 years of experience.

## Best Practices

* **IDE**: Use with **Google [[Antigravity]]** or **[[Cursor]]**.
* **Prompting**: It is "Intuitive". Don't be too rigid; use adjectives to describe the *feeling* you want.

## Verdict

**"If there were a Nobel Prize for coding, this year's winner is already decided."**
