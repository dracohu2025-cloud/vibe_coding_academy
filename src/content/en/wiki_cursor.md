# [[Cursor]]: The Reigning King of AI Editors

> "It's not just an editor; it's your digital twin."

**[[Cursor]]** is currently the most mature and well-rounded AI Native editor. Built on a fork of VS Code, it allows for a seamless transition while offering a completely redefined AI experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Tab (Copilot++)

[[Cursor]]'s autocomplete (Tab) is more than just line completion. It predicts cursor movement and your next edit location.
Write a variable name, and it might auto-complete the entire logic block for the next few lines. This "Flow" state is its biggest moat.

### 2. Composer

This is the multi-file editing mode (Cmd+I).
You can say: "Change the return field of this API, and update all frontend component type definitions."
It opens backend, frontend, and type files simultaneously and edits them all. This was unimaginable before.

### 3. Codebase Indexing

It deeply indexes your local codebase. When you ask "Where is the auth logic?", the answer is based on your actual code, not hallucinations.

## Verdict

**"As of now, it is the most stable and balanced choice."**
