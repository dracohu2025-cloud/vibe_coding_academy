# Claude Code: The Terminal Ghost

> "GUI is bloat. Real hackers use CLI."

**[[[[Claude Code]]]]** is Anthropic's CLI tool. No fancy interface, it lives in your Terminal.

## Core Gameplay

### 1. Deep System Integration

Once installed, it has all your terminal permissions (within reason).
It runs `git`, `ls` files, and `vim` edits directly.

### 2. "Refactor these 100 files"

This is its superpower.
For tedious refactoring tasks across dozens of files (e.g., "Change all class components to function components"), VS Code takes all day.
In terminal: `claude "Refactor all class components in src/ to functional components."`
Go grab a coffee.
30 minutes later, it's done, tests passed, and `git commit`ted.

### 3. MCP Support

Via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, it connects to your DB, Slack, GitHub Issues.
Ask it: "Check Issue #102, query the DB for related data, and try to fix the code."

## Verdict

**"Your shadow developer. Silent, efficient, lethal."**
