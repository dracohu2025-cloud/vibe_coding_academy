# Angular: Google's Heavy Tank

> "There is one right way to do it."

**Angular** is a full-featured Web Framework maintained by Google. Unlike React (which is a library), Angular is a **Platform**. It has everything built-in.

---

## Features

### 1. Batteries Included

Need Routing? Built-in.
Need Form Validation? Built-in.
Need HTTP Requests? Built-in.
Need Dependency Injection? Built-in.
You don't need to hunt for libraries; Angular has it all.

### 2. Strict & Typed

Angular was the first to embrace TypeScript. It mandates TS.
It has very strict architecture (Module, Service, Component, Pipe). This means any Angular developer can jump into any Angular codebase and understand it immediately.

## Why not Vibe?

1. **Too Heavy**:
    * Learning curve is a vertical wall. You need RxJS, TypeScript, Dependency Injection, Decorators...
    * For a startup or side project, it's overkill.

2. **Enterprise means... Boring**:
    * Angular is designed for banks, insurance companies, and massive CRM systems.
    * It lacks the "cool factor" of the React ecosystem. You rarely see design-forward works like Shadcn in the Angular world.

## Vibe Advice

If Google offers you a job, or a bank offers you $200k to maintain an Angular system.
**Learn it.**
Otherwise, **ignore it**. Life is too short to spend configuring NgModules.
