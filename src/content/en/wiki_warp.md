# Warp: The Terminal for the 21st Century

> "Stop using a terminal from the 1970s."

**[[Warp]]** is a modern terminal rewritten in Rust. It brings the IDE experience into the ancient world of the command line.

## Core Features

### 1. Blocks

In [[Warp]], every input and output is a "Block".
You can copy the output of a single command, or share just that block with a colleague. This solves the age-old problem of "how to copy just the error message without the previous command."

### 2. AI Command Search (`#`)

Can't remember how to untar a file?
Just type `# untar this file`, and [[Warp]] fills in the correct command.
It's like having ChatGPT built into your shell.

### 3. Warp Drive

Save common scripts as "Workflows" and share them with your team.
No more pasting shell scripts into Notion.

## Verdict

**"It finally makes the terminal feel like modern software."**
