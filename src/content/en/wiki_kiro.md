# Kiro: Spec-Driven Development

> "Think first, code later."

Vibe Coding emphasizes flow, but Engineering emphasizes rigor. **[[Kiro]]** is the rigorous engineer.

## Core Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

In [[Kiro]], you don't let AI code directly.
You make AI write **Specs** first.

1. Generate `requirements.md`: What is needed?
2. Generate `design.md`: How to architect?
3. Generate `task.md`: Steps?
Only when you approve these does [[Kiro]] start coding.

### 2. Quality Assurance

This mode is slower, but drastically reduces AI "hallucination". Every line of code is traceable to a Spec.

## Verdict

**"It cured my AI anxiety. No more hidden bugs."**
