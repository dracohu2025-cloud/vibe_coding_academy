# Vercel

## 1. What is Vercel? (The Frontend Cloud)

If [[Next.js]] is the sword, **[[Vercel]]** is the hand that wields it.
It is the creator of the **Frontend Cloud** and the company behind [[Next.js]].

In the world of Vibe Coding, deploying code shouldn't require "DevOps".
It should be as simple as saving a file.
**[[Vercel]] makes this a reality: Push to Git = Deploy.**

## 2. Core Magic

### Ultimate DX (Developer Experience)

* **Zero Config**: No `nginx.conf`, no Dockerfiles. If you have a `package.json`, it knows what to do.
* **Preview Deployments**: The killer feature for collaboration. Every Pull Request automatically generates a **unique preview URL**. Your PM and designers can check it instantly without waiting for a merge.

### Performance Beast

* **Edge Network**: A global CDN that serves your static assets from the location nearest to your user.
* **Serverless Functions**: Your backend APIs automatically become Serverless Functions. Infinite scaling, pay-per-use.

## 3. Vibe Best Practices

### The Perfect Match: Next.js

Deploying [[Next.js]] on [[Vercel]] unlocks superpowers like **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** and **Image Optimization** automatically.

### Environment Variables

Never commit `.env` to GitHub.
Configure them in the [[Vercel]] Dashboard. It cleanly separates Development, Preview, and Production environments.

### Speed is Everything

Vibe Coding is about **flow**.
Write code, `git push`, take a sip of coffee. 20 seconds later, the world sees your work.
That infinite feedback loop is what [[Vercel]] delivers.

## 4. Common Myths

* **"It's too expensive"**: For individuals and startups, the **Hobby Plan** is incredibly generous. It's enough to get you to Series A.
* **"It's just for static sites"**: Wrong. It supports full-stack deployment (SSR, Serverless API, Edge Middleware).
