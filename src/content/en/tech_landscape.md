# Tech Landscape: The 2025 Stack

> "Choice is more important than effort. Running in the wrong direction only makes you lost faster."

Beginners often fall into "Analysis Paralysis". The world has too many frameworks, libraries, and languages.
As your Vibe Coach, I won't list every option. I will give you the **Standard Answer**.

---

## 1. Frontend (The Frontline)

**Verdict**: Learn **[[[[React]]]]**.

* **[[[[React]]]] (The King)**: #1 Market share, #1 Ecosystem, #1 AI compatibility. [[[[Next.js]]]] is based on [[[[React]]]]. Learning [[[[React]]]] is learning the lingua franca.
* **[[[[Vue]]]] (The Elegant)**: Easy to start, clear syntax. Popular in Asia and small-mid companies. But in 2025, its TS support and AI generation (v0.dev) lag slightly behind the [[[[React]]]] ecosystem.
* **Svelte / Solid (The Vibe)**: Geek's favorite. No Virtual DOM, blazing fast. Great for personal projects, harder to find a job.
* **[[[[Angular]]]]**: Unless you are going to Google or a massive enterprise legacy corp, ignore it.

**The Vibe Path**: [[[[React]]]] -> [[[[Next.js]]]]. Don't look back.

## 2. UI & Styling (The Skin)

**Verdict**: **[[[[Tailwind CSS]]]] + [[Shadcn]]**.

* **[[[[Tailwind CSS]]]]**: Atomic CSS. It is the air and water of modern dev. Once you get used to it, you can't go back to standard CSS.
* **[[Shadcn]]**: The dominant UI library. It's not a package; it's code snippets. Total control + Premium aesthetics.
* **Ant Design (Antd)**: Standard for enterprise admins. Great for B2B dashboards, but too "generic corporate" for Vibe Coding.
* **MUI (Material UI)**: Google style. A bit outdated and heavy in bundle size.

**The Vibe Path**: Scaffold with Shadcn, tweak with Tailwind, animate with Framer Motion.

## 3. Backend (The Engine)

**Verdict**: **[[[[Next.js]]]] (Full Stack)** or **Python (AI)**.

* **[[[[Next.js]]]] (Node.js)**: For 90% of Web Apps, you don't need a standalone backend. [[[[Next.js]]]] Server Actions handle DB reads/writes. Full Stack TS is seamless.
* **Python (FastAPI / Django)**: If you need heavy AI integration. Python is the native language of AI. FastAPI is the modern choice.
* **Go (Gin / Echo)**: For extreme concurrency. ByteDance/Uber's choice. Overkill for rookies.
* **Java (Spring Boot)**: The standard for banking and enterprise. Mandatory for big corp jobs, but too heavy for Vibe Coding.

**The Vibe Path**: [[[[Next.js]]]] is your backend. If you need AI, spin up a FastAPI microservice.

## 4. Cross Platform (The Multi-verse)

**Verdict**: **[[[[React]]]] Native (Expo)**.

* **[[[[React]]]] Native (Expo)**: If you know [[[[React]]]], you can build Apps. Expo is amazing in 2025. One click deploy to iOS/Android.
* **Flutter (Dart)**: Made by Google. Renders every pixel like a game engine. Great performance, but requires learning Dart.
* **Electron**: Desktop apps (VS Code is built on it). Easy, but heavy on RAM.
* **Tauri (Rust)**: Challenger to Electron. Web frontend + Rust backend. Tiny size, high performance. Pick this if you know Rust.

**The Vibe Path**: Use Expo for iOS/Android. For desktop, ask if the Web version is enough first.
